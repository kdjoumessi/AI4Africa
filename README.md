This repository contains the code for our project titled, __Machine learning for Knee Osteoarthritis prediction__. This project was done at the end of the accelerated six months online program on Artificial Intelligence for young talented African Scientists 2020-2021


This project uses a dataset provided by the Al-Neelain Stem Cells Center (ASCC) in Sudan. This dataset was collected from patients to test the effect of a new treatment for knee osteoarthritis. 

From the raw data, we:
- perform data cleaning
-  digitalize the process of computing the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
-  propose a simple Machine learning model to predict the KOOS
